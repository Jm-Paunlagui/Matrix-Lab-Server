let the student expressed their selves in class, have an interactive activity. 

make sure, to be equal in giving students task, make sure that the quiz is though to the students very well. 
quizzes and especially exam should be at least very easy as it was discussed but the problem is, it was never been expound in the class, that makes the learners confused during the examination. 

he should frequently asked students about their affective learning, or at least talked to them through announcement or through class how they are.

"DIZON, AYA",DCI,COURSE 1010,i commend him for trying to be a good professor,"there are many things that our professor lacks of. first of all, he should at least notify the students if the scheduled date is synchronous or asynch. he should also attend in class and do his job as an instructor for he is always absent for almost the whole midterms and throughout the finals term. lastly, clear instructions and the proper usage of words when discussing is a what he lacks the most. he is teaching database management, not english grammar...he must consider what words to use when discussing since not all of us are adept in the english language which results in confusion of other students including me."

in other words, try to keep it crafty, and try to find ways where the students can learn the subject easier, rather than having them interpret the idea by themselves, which can be hard if they don't have a clue where to start piecing together the information within a topic."

"CORPUZ, SANDY",DCI,COURSE 1010,"the professor's initial design with how he would conduct the synchronous classes were optimal for making sure students are properly studying, as we are called at random to answer questions in regards to a preceding lesson file that was first uploaded within the week, but will eventually be the basis of graded recitation (at randomly selected participants) for the sake of monitoring and evaluating student progress within the lessons given. he also projected a tone that would necessarily imply to take the lessons seriously, as this course was ultimately our decision to pick up, and we stuck by that choice for two whole years and counting by the time this semester began.","although this may be attributed to preparing for a potential shift to face-to-face classes, the midterm and final term felt lacking in terms of activity. there are some, for sure, but the prelim term included a graded recitation that was promised throughout the whole semester. in other words, such graded recitations and activities were expected, but slowed to a halt as the final term precedes."

1. he didn't attend to his class on the right schedule. 
2. 2 or 3 weeks before the christmas break until the last week of class, he didn't attend in our class. all he gave is one power point presentations for finals.
3. during one of his discussions, he identified number zero in positive side of the number line. i am confused because i know that the zero is neutral number. i ask him about it, he insisted that the zero is only in the positive side. i searched it on google just to make sure and i realized that he is really wrong. i am concerned that the other students will receive this kind of false information.
4. i wish that he give more considerations to his students.
5. one time we ask him why he didn't follow our class schedule, he told us he has part time jobs in other schools. for this reason, we always adjusted our time for that reason. i suggests that he needs to make room also in adjustments.
6. we've waited for almost one month in his midterm exam, we always initiate the chat and i hope he take initiative sometimes about the exam.
7. i hope he will be a responsible professor because his students are always waiting for his classes and announcements."

"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,sir is very knowledgeable on his course and gives us example and techniques we can use on programming.,that thing i only want to comment is he needs to be always be on time or at least notify his students if he has class.
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,,
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,,sir should teach how to use different element in code and teach how to do a code.

"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,,
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,well-known to the subject,i encourage sir to be more diligence to a synchronous time
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,he is knowledgeable about the course,"his teaching method. first, he is not teaching us the basics of programming. we feel like we are doing a self study by ourselves. he provide a yt link for us to watch so we can understand the lesson which is truly helpful. but i wish he will show and teach us how to write a program by himself. i don't want to search codes in google anymore."
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,"1. his modules have complete teaching and easy to understand.
2. he's good at capturing students attention.
3. he have a unique strategy.","1. he should properly discuss the lessons for those students that have difficulty in understanding the given modules.
2. nakakalito siya magbigay ng verbal instructions.
3. mataas masyado siya magbigay ng expectations sa mga students."
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,it seems that prof. seems knowledgeable in this topic. however...,"i've only had bad experiences with prof. he sets schedules at times when it's not his schedule (in my class, it's every monday, from 5:30 to 8:30 pm), and oftentimes, he forgets that he has a class schedule to his set times. when he does attend his classes, around 20% of the time is spent on stories he tells us about his experiences. the remaining time is reserved for doing lab work where we code. he rarely shows us what he does when coding and only gave us a youtube channel of another professor in school.

if i have to be honest, i didn't learn much from him despite the module being helpful. i hope he gets replaced by a better teacher. if that happens, i wish him the best of luck and also to teach more."
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,,hope that someday kindly explain the lesson further and clearly.

"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,strength as my instructor in teaching cs 101 is that he teaches but it needs improvement because his course is our major. 🙂,"the area he needs to give learning improvement is to interact with his students because not everyone learns immediately in his assigned tasks. and, as a professor, learn to encourage the student no matter what happens. have an adequate teaching strategy which will extend it well to how his students will learn what he teaches specifically in programming."

"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,,
"DEL ROSARIO, FRANCES",DCI,COURSE 1010,his time to meet us virtually,"for me, wala naman po masama kung sasabihin kong hindi siya nagbibigay ng examples on how we will do the program. all we do is self-study. modular type of studying. bilang hindi naman lahat ng estudyante may pare parehas na accuracy sa pag intindi lalo sa module na type compare sa estudyanteng mas nagegets yung topic kapag itinuturo talaga ito. we know the ""nasa estudyante yan kung gusto matuto"" pero since ako hindi ako masyadong knowledgable sa programming i still studying my programming ability nanonood nalang ako dun sa channel ni maam regz na nakaupload sa youtube niya para atleast doon po may matutunan ako kahit paunti unti."
